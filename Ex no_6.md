## AIM:
To write a C Program to print the string "KEYBOARD" n number of times.

## Algorithm
  1.Start the program.
  2.Declare an integer variable n. 
  3.Take input from the user for the number of times to print the string.
  4.Use a loop from 1 to n to print the string "KEYBOARD".
  5.End the program.
